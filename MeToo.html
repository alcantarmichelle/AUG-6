      <h2>In 2007, an era where hashtags didn’t exist, Tarana Burke pioneered the Me Too campaign.<br> Burke, the founder and director of the youth organization Just Be Inc., started the Me Too<br>campaign as a grass-roots movement to reach sexual assault survivors in underprivileged communities. <br>The phrase “Me Too” was to be used between survivors in order to let them know that they weren’t alone in the healing process. It was a symbol of hope that  a movement for radical healing could be made possible through solidarity. The campaign developed into a hashtag when actress Alyssa Milano encouraged her followers on Twitter to share their stories of sexual harassment and assault using the hashtag #MeToo.</h3>
